Alpha Beta is an optimisation to the minimax algorithm used to evaluate the play a game play pay off. The Alpha beta algorithm exploits the idea of something called a minimising and maximising player. Lets take a look at a 2 player game like aye, now if I am playing against an opponent, it is assumed that the opponent is playing to win the game also and as such would play to either have most seeds or play to make sure I have as small winnings as possible. Now, this player could be regarded to as the minimising player therefore if the player thought about a move and in the move he realised that if he played lets say the first hole, he would loose 2 seeds I.e I would win 2 seeds, but playing the second hole, he would loose just one seed or I would gain 1 seed, the player would select the minimum among both options and as such is most likely going to play the second hole. Now, assuming   for some reason the player could build like a game tree of more than 1 depth in his mid(maybe he is a genius or something), if he realises that after playing the first hole, and returning the value to be 2 as said earlier, while checking the next play if playing hole 3 at first makes him loose 3 seeds, he would immediately know that hole 3 isn't a viable option since there is already an option that allows him loose a smaller number of seeds. Therefore he won't even bother bulding the game tree of hole 3 since he would never even play it and as so doing, he has pruned the tree and only needs to evaluate other hole asides from 3 reducing the amount of work he has to do and the time to do it. Sorry I can't give a graphical representation. My text editor is pretty limited. If any unclarity is encountered, any material online or video would help.
