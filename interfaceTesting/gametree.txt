				Equation for game transition

The game state changes because of the variable content it contains. That is at a particular time, the game state could be as follows:

	[1 2 3 4 5 6]
	[2 7 2 8 2 2]

But after a play, the state changes since its content would change. For example if hole 1 of the first player is played, the new game board state is:

	[2 0 3 4 5 6]
	[0 7 2 8 2 2]

Therefore it is imperative to represent the change. The change of a game board state is due to a factor causing change(e.g negotiation, je aye apa, a play or even a capture). This factor can be represented as [s] where the s is the number of seeds captured due to the factor. Another variable can be introduced which will denote the hole played that lead to the capture of some seed. This variable labeled h(I) where h denote holes and I denote the number; so, h(2) means play hole 2. Putting it all together, if a game state is to transform, h(I) and [s] would be given. When this variables are given, the game board would change. For example, given the current game board;

	[2 3 2 2 9 4]
	[1 2 1 4 5 5]
Given h(2) and [5] this means playing hole 2 would result in capture of 5 seeds producing the new game board below; 
	
	[3 0 2 2 9 4]
	[0 0 1 4 5 5]

Thus the game board state has changed.So, it can be seen that a new game board is a function of the previous game board I.e a new game board is gotten by performing some operations on the previous game board. Therefore, if the current game board is represented as M(I) and the next game board as M(I+1), then it is right to say that;
			h(i) [s]
		M(I) -------------> M(I+1)

That is a current board gets transformed to a new board if the  operation h(i) which means "play hole I and wind s number of seeds" is executed.
